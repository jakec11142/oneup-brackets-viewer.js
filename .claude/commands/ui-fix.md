description: Refactor UI to match reference design using ui-revamp-reuse-first agent
---

Use the ui-revamp-reuse-first agent to refactor existing UI components to match a reference design
while strictly adhering to the project's design system.

This agent will:

1. Analyze the reference design (screenshot, Figma, mockup, etc.)
2. Map it to existing components in the design system
3. Create a reuse-first refactoring plan
4. Preserve design tokens and component architecture
5. Identify minimal changes needed

Best for: Updating UI to match new designs, redesigns, mockup implementations.

The user's UI refactoring task or reference design will follow this instruction.
