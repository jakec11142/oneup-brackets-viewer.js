description: Build new UI features using the ui-feature-builder agent
---

Use the ui-feature-builder agent to implement UI features, components, or pages.

This agent will:

1. Scan existing components for reuse patterns
2. Map to design system standards (.claude/ui-standards.md)
3. Propose a reuse-first implementation plan
4. Build the feature following project conventions

The user's UI task or feature request will follow this instruction.
