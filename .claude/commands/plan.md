description: Create detailed implementation plan using the Plan agent
---

Use the Plan agent to explore the codebase and create a detailed implementation plan.

This agent will:

1. Thoroughly explore relevant code and patterns
2. Understand the current architecture
3. Create a step-by-step implementation plan
4. Identify files to modify and components to create
5. Present the plan for approval before coding

Use this for complex tasks that need planning before implementation.

The user's task to plan will follow this instruction.
